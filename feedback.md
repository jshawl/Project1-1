# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Excellent job on your user stories! In the future, consider linking to a Trello board that shows your
user stories in current, backlog, and icebox lists

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Excellent job on this project! I would encourage you to think of a way to let the user choose the number
of cards shown. Related to that, try creating the HTML from your JS as a first step.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Excellent Excellent code commenting!! Your code is very well structured and easy to understand. If you 
were to revisit this project, I would recommend an object oriented approach - use one global object to store all the attributes
and methods of your game.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. The commentary about unsolved problems in your README is excellent! This will be useful to re-read
as you go into Project 2 or an interview where they ask you to explain your code. I'd be happy to work with you on these outstanding issues
- let me know!

Overall, excellent job on this project!!
