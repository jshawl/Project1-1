<h2> Project 1 Review </h2>
<h4>Here are the outstanding issues I was not able to resolve</h4>
<ol>
<li>The timer at the bottom of the page "refreshes" (but does not reset) every time i click on a card. I tried to use .bind and .one to prevent this from happening, but was not successful. The .bind function is still in my Javascript file 56-58. </li>
<li>If i double click a card quickly it is matching with itself and will stay turned over</li>
<li>In general, I know my Javascript is messy. Like, really messy. This was how the game made sense to me. Would love to go over how to refactor.
</ol>
